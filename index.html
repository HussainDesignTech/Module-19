                You can call me Hussain; In my free time I love to go hiking or kayaking, or anything outdoors where you can mingle in the jungle.
                I spend most of my money on traveling, because I believe traveling keeps you young and makes you wiser. My favorite part of the world is New Zealand, where you ramble on the green landscapes, sight a herd of sheep, and breath fresh air. I also love Canada, Toronto, Niagara Falls, and Banff National park in Alberta. I met so many friends in New Zealand, and Canada, and learnt from their culture and experiences. I told you traveling makes you wiser, and I’ll add that it shows you our plant is full of beautiful people, and marvelous sceneries.  
                
                I almost forgot to mention that I enjoy reading non fictional books which teach you how to be a better person by improving your interpersonal and communications skills. If I want to relax mentally, I’d pause life, go to a coffee shop, have my white mocha, and read a good book. Improving my spirit and mentality is extremely important to constantly upgrade my life. 
                
                This is a short overview of me, and I hope you have as beautiful day as yourself! </p>
